# Programming Overview and Options

There are a variety of ways to create programs for the Astro-8. 

* The lowest level way is through Astrisc, the assembly language. This is the most difficult way to make a program, but you have the most control.
* A level higher is Armstrong, which is essentially an abstraction layer upon the Assembly. It is easier to use, but still lacks many features.
* The highest level language is called Yabal (**Y**et **A**nother **B**asic **A**stro-8 **L**anguage). This is very easy to use, and can be compared to C in it's syntax.

{: .tip}
The easiest starting point is Yabal! It is very similar to many other modern languages
